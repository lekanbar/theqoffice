<b>2.	EPHASE’S OBLIGATIONS.</b>
<br />
Contingent on Ephase’s acceptance of your Order, and subject to these Terms of Service, Ephase agrees to provide the Services. Ephase agrees to follow security procedures at least as stringent determined by our reasonable judgment.

<br />
<br />
<b>3.	CUSTOMER’S OBLIGATIONS.</b>
You agree to do each of the following: (i) comply with applicable law and The Q-Office Acceptable Use Policy (ii) pay when due the fees for the Services, (iii) use reasonable security precautions in light of your use of the Services, (iv) cooperate with Ephase’s reasonable investigation of outages, security problems, and any suspected breach of the Agreement, (v) keep your billing contact and other account information up to date; and (vi) immediately notify Ephase of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security. In the event of a dispute between us regarding the interpretation of applicable law or the AUP, Ephase’s reasonable determination shall control.

<br />
<br />
<b>4.	ACCESS TO SERVICES.</b>
You may access the Services via the online control panel, or via an Ephase-provided Application Programming Interface or API. Ephase may modify its control panel or APIs at any time, or may transition to new API's. Your use of any API you download from the Ephase website is governed by the license terms included with the code

<br />
<br />
<b>5.	TERM.</b>
The initial term for each Order begins on the date we make the Services available for your use and continues for the period stated in the Order. If no period is stated in the Order, then the initial term shall be one year. Upon expiration of the initial term, you shall be required to renew the Order to continue use of our services. Non-renewal shall result in termination of the concerned service and other dependent services.

<br />
<br />
<b>6.	FEES.</b>
Ephase will charge you the fees stated in your Order. You will be required to pay the required amount before any services are provided to you. In cases of online payment, such transactions are to be initiated by you. Unless otherwise agreed in the Order, your billing cycle will be yearly, beginning on the date that Ephase first makes the Services available to you. Ephase may suspend all services (including services provided pursuant to any unrelated Order or other agreement we may have with you) if payments are not collected and confirmed so, for any reason. Ephase may charge interest on overdue amounts at 1.5% per month if any amount is overdue by more than thirty (30) days, and if Ephase brings a legal action to collect, or engages a collection agency, you must also pay Ephase’s reasonable costs of collection, including attorney fees and court costs. All fees are stated and will be charged in Nigerian naira. Any "credit" that we may owe you, such as a credit for failure to meet a service level guaranty, will be applied to fees due from you for services, and will not be paid to you as a refund. Charges that are not disputed within sixty (60) days of the date charged are conclusively deemed accurate. You must provide Ephase with accurate factual information to help Ephase determine if any tax is due with respect to the provision of the Services, and if Ephase is required by law to collect taxes on the provision of the Services, you must pay Ephase the amount of the tax that is due or provide satisfactory evidence of your exemption from the tax. You authorize Ephase to obtain a credit report at any time during the term of the Agreement. Any credit that we may owe you will be applied to unpaid fees for services or refunded to you, at our option.

<br />
<br />
<b>7.	FEE INCREASES. </b>
We may at any time increase our service fees, effective as of the first day of the renewal term of your service. 

<br />
<br />
<b>8.	SUSPENSION.</b>
We may suspend your Services without liability if: (i) we reasonably believe that the Services are being used (or have been or will be used) in violation of the Agreement, (ii) we discover that you are, or are affiliated in any manner with, a person who has used similar services abusively in the past; (iii) you don't cooperate with our reasonable investigation of any suspected violation of the Agreement; (iv) we reasonably believe that your Services have been accessed or manipulated by a third party without your consent, (v) we reasonably believe that suspension of the Services is necessary to protect our network or our other customers, (vi) a payment for the Services is overdue, or (vii) suspension is required by law. We will give you reasonable advance notice of a suspension under this paragraph and a chance to cure the grounds on which the suspension are based, unless we determine, in our reasonable commercial judgment, that a suspension on shorter or contemporaneous notice is necessary to protect Ephase or its other customers from imminent and significant operational or security risk. If the suspension was based on your breach of your obligations under the Agreement, then we may continue to charge you the fees for the Services during the suspension.

<br />
<br />
<b>9. 	TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE.</b>
You may terminate the Agreement for convenience at any time on thirty days advance written notice. If you terminate the Agreement for convenience, you shall be required to pay any amounts owed.

<br />
11.1 You will not have access to your data stored on Ephase’s servers during a suspension or following termination.
<br />
11.2 We backup The Q-Office system on a periodic basis so that we are able to more quickly restore the systems in the event of a failure.

In addition, we may destroy all but the most recent backup. These backups may not be available to you.
<br />
11.3 You agree that you will maintain at least one additional current copy of your programs and data stored on The Q-Office system somewhere other than on the system itself.

<br />
<br />

<br />
<b>13.	DISCLAIMERS.</b>
<b>We do not promise that the Services will be uninterrupted, error-free, or completely secure.

We disclaim any and all warranties not expressly stated in the Agreement, including the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

i.	To our respective service providers, agents, and representatives, provided that such service providers, agents, or representatives agree to confidentiality measures that are at least as stringent as those stated in these General Terms and Conditions.
ii.	To law enforcement or government agency if required by a subpoena or other compulsory legal process, or if either of us believes, in good faith, that the other's conduct may violate applicable criminal law as required by law; or
iii.	In response to a subpoena or other compulsory legal process, provided that each of us agrees to give the other written notice of at least seven days prior to disclosing Confidential Information under this subsection (or prompt notice in advance of disclosure, if seven days advance notice is not reasonably feasible), unless the law forbids such notice.

<br />
<br />
<b>15.	LIMITATION ON DAMAGES.</b>
Our obligations to you are defined by this Agreement. We are not liable to you for failing to provide the Services unless 
the failure results from a breach of this Agreement, or results from our gross negligence or willful misconduct. The extended 
periods of service/extra services we might choose to provide are your <b>sole and exclusive</b> remedy for unavailability of 
the Services.
<b>Neither of us (nor any of our employees, agents, affiliates or suppliers) is liable to the other for any lost profits or any other indirect, special, incidental or consequential loss or damages of any kind, or for any loss that could have been avoided by the damaged party's use of reasonable diligence, even if the party responsible for the damages has been advised or should be aware of the possibility of such damages. In no event shall either of us be liable to the other for any punitive damages.
Notwithstanding anything in the Agreement to the contrary, except for liability based on willful misconduct or fraudulent misrepresentation, and liability for death or personal injury resulting from Ephase’s negligence, the maximum aggregate monetary liability of Ephase and any of its employees, agents, suppliers, or affiliates in connection with the Services, the Agreement, and any act or omission related to the Services or Agreement, under any theory of law (including breach of contract, tort, strict liability, violation of law, and infringement) shall not exceed the greater of (i) the amount of fees you paid for the Services for the six months prior to the occurrence of the event giving rise to the claim, or (ii) Seven thousand Naira (N7000.00).
</b>

<br />
<br />
<b>16.	INDEMNIFICATION.</b>
If we, our affiliates, or any of our or their respective employees, agents, or suppliers (the <b>"Ephase Indemnitees"</b>) are faced with a legal claim by a third party arising out of your actual or alleged gross negligence, willful misconduct, violation of law, failure to meet the security obligations required by the Agreement, violation of the AUP of these Terms and Conditions, then you will pay the cost of defending the claim (including reasonable attorney fees) and any damages award, fine, or other amount that is imposed on the Ephase Indemnitees as a result of the claim. Your obligations under this subsection include claims arising out of the acts or omissions of your employees, any other person to whom you have given access to the Services, and any person who gains access to the Services as a result of your failure to use reasonable security precautions, even if the acts or omissions of such persons were not authorized by you. We will choose legal counsel to defend the claim, provided that these decisions must be reasonable and must be promptly communicated to you. You must comply with our reasonable requests for assistance and cooperation in the defence of the claim. We may not settle the claim without your consent, although such consent may not be unreasonably withheld. You must pay expenses due under this Section as we incur them.

<br />
<br />
<b>17.	CHANGES TO THE ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY.</b>
We may change our Acceptable Use Policy, provided that any changes are reasonable and consistent with applicable law and industry norms. Any such changes made during the term of your Agreement will become effective to your account upon the first to occur of: (i) renewal, (ii) your execution of a new/additional Order for your account that incorporates the revised AUP or General Terms. If the change materially and adversely affects you, you may terminate the Agreement by giving us written notice of termination on such grounds no later than thirty (30) days following the date the change became effective for your account, and we will not enforce the change with respect to that account for thirty (30) days following the date of your notice.

<br />
<br />
<b>20.	FORCE MAJEURE.</b>
