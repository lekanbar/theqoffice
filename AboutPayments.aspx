ABOUT PAYING ONLINE (Nigeria only)

<hr />
    </div>
    The online payment module provides a secure channel for you to pay for our services using an Interswtich-powered debit card.
    <br />
    <span style="color:Red">WE DO NOT COLLECT ANY CARD DETAILS FROM YOU.</span>
    <br /><br />
    After you successfully calclulated the amount you are required to pay based on the number of years of subscription, and the
     optional discount code, you would be directed to a secure payment page from where the financial transaction 
     would be initiated.
     <br /><br />
     In event of a successful payment, you would receive an email confirming a successful registration. Please allow one working
     day for us to setup your website. After your website has been setup, we would send you an email with an access code which
     would grant you access to the final phase of registration. Completion of this final registration phase  grants you access to
     the admin panel of your website. You can always send us an email at support@theqoffice.com if there any issues concerning
     the transaction made or the registration process.
