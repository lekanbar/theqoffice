TELL ME ABOUT IT
<hr />
    </div>
    We think we just found a more innovative way of doing business and we're sure you can't get this anywhere else!
    <br /><br />
    We talked to several small business owners from different industries to find out their peculiar needs and how a 
    simple concept such as a website can help them advertise more and communicate better and we came up with The Q-Office.
    <br /><br />
    Basically, The Q-Office project helps you create a dynamic website in 24 hours, but we aim to create a business
    revolution with that simple concept.
    We are building in more tools for customer relationship management, electronic commerce support and every other
    business aspect that can be supported adequately on the internet.
    
    <br /><br />
    We think you, the business owner, are the most important part of this service and we\d love to hear from you.
    Our doors are always open to everyone who has interesting 
    ideas on how we can do a better job. Such opinions are welcome at suggestions@theqoffice.com.
